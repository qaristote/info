    We study monoidal transducers, transition systems arising as deterministic
    automata whose transitions also produce outputs in an arbitrary monoid, for
    instance allowing outputs to commute or to cancel out. We use the
    categorical framework for minimization and learning of Colcombet, Petrişan
    and Stabile to recover the notion of minimal transducer recognizing a
    language, and give necessary and sufficient conditions on the output monoid
    for this minimal transducer to exist and be unique (up to isomorphism). The
    categorical framework then provides an abstract algorithm for learning it
    using membership and equivalence queries, and we discuss practical aspects
    of this algorithm’s implementation.

    I'll then discuss how this is an instance of the categorical framework for

    this framework.

    We give a new proof of a result from well quasi-order theory on the
    computability of bases for upwards-closed sets of words. This new proof is
    based on Angluin's L* algorithm, that learns an automaton from a minimally
    adequate teacher. This relates in particular two results from the 1980s:
    Angluin's L* algorithm, and a result from Valk and Jantzen on the
    computability of bases for upwards-closed sets of tuples of integers.


    Along the way, we describe an algorithm for learning quasi-ordered automata
    from a minimally adequate teacher, and extend a generalization of Valk and
    Jantzen's result, encompassing both words and integers, to finitely
    generated monoids.

    We study automata weighted over number rings, that is, rings of integers in
    an algebraic number field.


    We show that number rings are what we call "almost strong Fatou": if an
    n-state automaton weighted in a number field recognizes an integer-valued
    series, then it admits an equivalent n+1-state automaton weighted in the
    corresponding ring of integers.


    We give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing such an n+1-state
    automaton, and show that removing any more states is at least as hard as
    solving the principal ideal problem, for which the best currently known
    algorithm is in quantum polynomial time.


    Finally, we will see how this procedure can be used to reduce active
    learning problems in number rings to active learning problems in fields. If
    time allows, I will also give a brief explanation of how this generalizes to
    a generic reduction procedure between active learning problems for automata
    valued in different categories.

  abstract: >-
    We develop a generic reduction procedure for active learning problems. Our
    approach is inspired by a recent polynomial-time reduction of the exact
    learning problem for weighted automata over integers to that for weighted
    automata over rationals (Buna-Marginean et al. 2024). Our procedure improves
    the efficiency of a category-theoretic automata learning algorithm, and
    poses new questions about the complexity of its implementation when
    instantiated to concrete categories. 


    As our second main contribution, we address these complexity aspects in the
    concrete setting of learning weighted automata over number rings, that is,
    rings of integers in an algebraic number field. Assuming a full
    representation of a number ring OK, we obtain an exact learning algorithm of
    OK-weighted automata that runs in polynomial time in the size of the target
    automaton, the logarithm of the length of the longest counterexample, the
    degree of the number field, and the logarithm of its discriminant. Our
    algorithm produces an automaton that has at most one more state than the
    minimal one, and we prove that doing better requires solving the principal
    ideal problem, for which the best currently known algorithm is in quantum
    polynomial time.

    Noticing the similarity between the monotone weak distributive laws
    combining two layers of nondeterminisms in sets and in compact Hausdorff
    spaces, we study whether the latter law can be obtained automatically as a
    weak lifting of the former. This holds partially, but does not generalize to
    other categories of algebras: we then characterize when exactly monotone
    weak distributive laws over powerset monads in categories of algebras exist,
    exhibiting a law combining probabilities and non-determinism in compact
    Hausdorff spaces and showing on the other hand that such laws do not exist
    in a lot of other cases.

    Within the study of the semantics of programming languages, computational
    effects may be modelled with monads, and weak distributive laws between
    monads are then a tool to combine two such effects.


    In both the category of sets and the category of compact Hausdorff spaces,
    there is a monotone weak distributive law that combines two layers of
    non-determinism. Noticing the similarity between these two laws, we study
    whether the latter can be obtained automatically as some sort of lifting of
    the former.


    More specifically, we show how a framework for constructing monotone weak
    distributive laws in regular categories lifts to categories of algebras,
    giving a full characterization for the existence of monotone weak
    distributive laws therein. We then exhibit such a law, combining
    probabilities and non-determinism, in compact Hausdorff spaces; but we also
    show how such laws do not exist in a lot of other cases.

  abstract: >-
    When studying the semantics of programming languages, monads are a tool to
    model computational effects. Given two monads modelling two effects, a
    natural question is whether one can build a composed monad modelling the
    combination of these two effects. There is a generic way to do this when
    there exists a monotone weak distributive law between the two monads.


    Monotone weak distributive laws are a recently-developed mathematical tool,
    and the first part of the talk will focus on introducing them and giving
    several examples. The second part of the talk will then focus on the main
    result from [1], which gives a full characterization for the existence of
    monotone weak distributive laws in certain categories of algebras.

    Joint work with Daniela Petrişan. This paper provides a unifying
    category-theoretic framework for minimization and learning algorithms for
    bottom-up tree automata with effects. Our aim is two-fold: encompass
    existing algorithms for various forms of tree automata – deterministic
    bottom-up tree automata, residual finite tree automata, tree automata
    weighted over a field – and instantiate the abstract framework in order to
    obtain new results – tree automata weighted over prinicipal ideal domains
    (PIDs).
